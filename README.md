# Getting Started with React & Tailwind (ATELIER MODE)

It includes a header, hero section, product categories, featured products, and a footer with links and social icons.

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
